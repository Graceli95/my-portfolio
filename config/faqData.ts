    id: "transition",
    question: "How did you transition into software development and AI?",
    answer:
      "As a first-generation immigrant, I had to rebuild my path in a new country. I began by teaching myself through online programming courses, which led me to a front-end bootcamp (React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS) and later a Java Full-Stack bootcamp where I learned Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, SQL, and MySQL.\n\nBuilding projects helped me discover how much I enjoy backend logic and system design, so I continued growing through Year Up's IT track and Arizona State University's Vibe Coding AI Builder Architect Program, where I learned to build AI-powered applications using Python, FastAPI, Next.js, LangChain, LangGraph, and AWS Bedrock.\n\nMy transition into tech has been a step-by-step journey of continuous learning, persistence, embracing new tools with confidence, and believing in my ability to grow.",
