    id: "transition",
    question: "How did you transition into software development and AI?",
    answer:
      "As a first-generation immigrant, I transitioned from a business background to software development through dedication and continuous learning. I started with coding bootcamps focused on front-end and Java full-stack development. As I built more projects, I discovered my passion for backend logic, problem-solving, and system design. This led me to deeper training: a Java Full-Stack program at Per Scholas, Year Up's IT track, and ASU's AZNext Vibe Coding AI Builder Architect program, where I learned to build AI-powered applications using Python, FastAPI, LangChain, and LangGraph.",
  },
  {
    id: "bootcamps",
    question: "What bootcamps and training have you completed?",
    answer:
      "I've completed several comprehensive training programs: ASU Vibe Coding AI Builder Architect Program (AI development), Year Up United IT Support Training (currently ongoing through July 2026), Per Scholas Java Full-Stack Development Bootcamp, and Solely Coding Bootcamp (Web Development). Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Management from Henan Normal University.",

    id: "background-asset",
    question: "What makes your background an asset in tech?",
    answer:
      "Moving between countries and careers has trained me to adapt quickly, pay attention to cultural differences, and stay humble and curious. I'm used to being the person who has to catch up, and that pushes me to prepare thoroughly, listen carefully, and follow through. I bring empathy for users, persistence in debugging, and a growth mindset to every project. My multilingual abilities (fluent in English and Mandarin) and cross-cultural experience also help me collaborate effectively in diverse teams.",

  {
    id: "learning-next",
    question: "What are you most excited to learn next?",
    answer:
      "I'm especially excited about agentic AI, workflow automation, and using tools like LangGraph to orchestrate multiple AI 'agents' that work together. I also want to keep improving my foundational skills in system design, testing, and scalable backend architecture. The intersection of traditional software engineering and AI is where I see the most potential for innovation.",
  },
  {
    id: "languages",
