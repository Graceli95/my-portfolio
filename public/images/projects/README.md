# Project Screenshots

Add your project screenshots to this folder with the following filenames:

## Required Files:

1. **jobportal.png** - AI-Powered JobPortal Platform screenshot
2. **vitality-hub.png** - Vitality Hub Fitness Tracker screenshot
3. **ecommerce.png** - Eyeglass E-commerce Website screenshot
4. **covilla.png** - Covilla Travel Agency Website screenshot

## Image Specifications:

- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **Recommended Size:** 1200x800px or 1920x1080px (16:9 ratio works best)
- **File Size:** Keep under 500KB for optimal loading (use TinyPNG.com to compress)
- **Quality:** High resolution, showing the main features of your project

## Tips for Great Screenshots:

1. **Capture the homepage or main dashboard** of each project
2. **Show the UI in action** (with data, not empty states)
3. **Use a clean browser window** (hide bookmarks bar, extensions)
4. **Ensure good lighting/contrast** for readability
5. **Take full-page screenshots** when possible

## How Screenshots Are Used:

These images will automatically appear on:
- Home page (Featured Projects section)
- Projects page (Detailed project cards)

Once you add the files here, they'll be immediately visible on your portfolio website!

## Placeholder Images:

Until you add your own screenshots, the site will use placeholder images or fallback to a gradient background.
