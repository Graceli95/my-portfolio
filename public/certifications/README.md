# Certification Files

Add your certification PDFs or images to this folder with the following filenames:

## Required Files:

1. **asu-ai-builder.pdf** - ASU AZNext Vibe Coding AI Builder Architect
2. **pluralsight-agentic-ai.pdf** - Pluralsight Agentic AI for Developers
3. **per-scholas-java.pdf** - Per Scholas Java Full Stack Development
4. **umich-programming.pdf** - University of Michigan Programming for Everybody
5. **deeplearning-ai.pdf** - DeepLearning.AI AI for Everyone

## File Specifications:

- **Format:** PDF (preferred) or high-quality image (PNG/JPG)
- **File Size:** Keep under 2MB for optimal loading
- **Naming:** Use exact filenames listed above (lowercase, hyphens)

## How to Add Certificates:

1. Save your certificate files with the names above
2. Copy them to this folder (`/public/certifications/`)
3. The "View Credential" links will automatically work

## Alternative: External URLs

If your certificates are hosted elsewhere (Coursera, Credly, etc.), you can update the URLs in `/config/skillsData.ts` to point to those external links instead:

```typescript
credentialUrl: "https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/..."
```

## Privacy Note:

These files will be publicly accessible on your portfolio website. Make sure you're comfortable sharing them publicly, or use external credential platforms that provide verification links.
