   - Java, Spring Boot, React, Python, FastAPI, AI tools

3. **How did you transition into software development and AI?**
   - First-generation immigrant, transitioned from business background to software development. I started with coding bootcamps that focused on front-end and Java full-stack development. As I built more projects, I realized I enjoyed backend logic, problem-solving, and system design. That led me to deeper training: a Java Full-Stack program, Year Up’s IT track, and then ASU’s AZNext Vibe Coding AI Builder Architect program, where I learned how to use tools like Python, FastAPI, LangChain, and LangGraph to build AI-powered applications.

4. **What bootcamps and training have you completed?**
   - ASU AI Builder Architect, Year Up IT Track, Per Scholas Java Full-Stack, Solely Coding Bootcamp

5. **What kinds of projects have you worked on?**
 -I’ve worked on a mix of full-stack and AI-powered projects, including:
  A JobPortal platform with AI-assisted candidate matching
  A fitness tracking application (Vitality Hub)
  An e-commerce eyewear store (React + Redux)
  A travel agency website built with web fundamentals
  You can see more details in the Projects section of this portfolio.

1. **What makes your background an asset in tech?**
   - Moving between countries and careers has trained me to adapt quickly, pay attention to cultural differences, and stay humble and curious. I’m used to being the person who has to catch up, and that pushes me to prepare thoroughly, listen carefully, and follow through. I bring empathy for users, persistence in debugging, and a growth mindset to every project.

2. **What are you most excited to learn next?**
   - I’m especially excited about agentic AI, workflow automation, and using tools like LangGraph to orchestrate multiple AI “agents” that work together. I also want to keep improving my foundational skills in system design, testing, and scalable backend architecture.

3. **What languages do you speak?**
   - Fluent in English and Chinese (Mandarin)
  
4. **What do you enjoy outside of coding?**
    -In my free time I like to watch live music performances, read, and bake delicious breads and desserts, with Focaccia bread and Tiramisu being my favorites. I stay active and enjoy hiking, swimming, traveling, and doing yoga. I take a pottery class weekly and I really enjoy creating and building things with my hands.

5.  **Why did you create this portfolio website?**
    -This portfolio is more than a collection of projects—it’s a snapshot of my journey. I built it to share my work, my story, and my growth as a developer and AI builder. I also wanted a space where I could keep adding new conferences, hackathons, and learning experiences as I keep moving forward.
